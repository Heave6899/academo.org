<p>
	This demo allows you to enter a mathematical expression in terms of x and y. When you hit the calculate button, the demo will
	calculate the value of the expression over the x and y ranges provided and then plot the result as a surface.
	The graph can be zoomed in by scrolling with your mouse, and rotated by dragging around. Clicking on the graph will reveal the x, y and z values at that particular point.
